Widget Layout Documentation

Widgets can be moved around and customized. These customizations are to be saved and persisted so the user doesn't have
to recustomize their dashboard every single time they refresh the browser.

THe widget layout consists of a list where each value in the list describes a widget's details. Depending on the type of 
widget, this data can be different. However, a shared value is the row number which describes which row the widget lies in.
This value is completely ignored on mobile. 

An example widget layout follows:
